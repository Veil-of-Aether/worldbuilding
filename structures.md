# Structures

### Shrine of Elements
The Shrine of Elements lays in the exact center of the world, at the point where the four provinces meet. This shrine houses the Pedestal of Ages, the Horn of Awakening, and many other sacred artifacts. The inside of the shrine features marble architecture and a large dome. The Spire of Equinox hangs down into the center of the shrine, suspended by four magical chains.

### Spire of Equinox
The Spire of Equinox is a large pillar reaching into the heavens from the Shrine of Elements. It is held in place by four magical, glowing chains. The Spire is the only way to reach the Light Realm high above the world. One who wields the Sword of the Elements may raise it into the Spire to be magically transported up to the Light Realm.

### Crucible of Trial
The Crucible of Trial is a cave with many levels underneath the Shrine of Elements. The entrance is a hole right outside the Shrine. The Crucible contains 30 levels with monsters of increasing difficulty the farther down one goes, with an additional rest point every 5 levels. At the very bottom is a magic artifact that increases health and stamina capacity.

### Earth Temple
The Earth Temple is located at the far south of the known land, on the southern edge of Earth Province. The temple features crude granite and sandstone architecture and many small corridors. Over time, vines have crept up the eroding walls, and many cracks have formed. Terra the Earth Wizard resides in a large chamber near the back of the temple.

### Fire Temple
The Fire Temple is carved into the side of Mount Vulkareth in west Fire Province. It features flowing lava rivers and an architecture of obsidian and other igneous rocks. The temple has many large, open areas, often filled with lava pools. Ignis the Fire Mage lives in a high chamber near the center, elevated above the main floor.

### Water Temple
The Water Temple is a submerged in the Great Sea in eastern Water Province. The temple is full of underwater hallways and labyrinths, with some rooms protruding from out of the water. The temple is constructed from wet stone and glassy crystal. Aqua the Water Sorceress is in a large central chamber protruding out from the sea.

### Wind Temple
The Wind Temple is on a floating island in the far north of Wind Province. It is tall ornately designed out of smooth marble and a light, white wood. The interior is full of intricate carved inscriptions. The design features large rooms, often with large gaps leading to falls. Zephyr the Wind Enchantress takes residence in the open air at the top of the structure.


### Forest Sanctuary
The Forest Sanctuary is located in Erdewald Forest, just south of Gaia Village and near the edge of Verbotenholz. This structure was once a bastion against Dolmordaiâ€™s forces during the War of Fallen Glory, but is now rather overgrown.
