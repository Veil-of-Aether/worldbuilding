## [After Forest Sanctuary]
Torric meets Darian outside the Forest Sanctuary. He explains Darian’s untold backstory. (this has a cutscene to go with it, showing the events)
"Many years ago, this land was torn apart by a great war against the demon king. The Forest Sanctuary—yes, the very one you just braved—was our final refuge, the last stronghold that held back the tide of darkness. It’s not an exaggeration to say we owe our survival to it."

"So, when strange happenings began there once again, it’s no wonder the townsfolk grew uneasy. Your grandfather and I, foolishly brave as we were, ventured inside to investigate. We expected crumbling ruins or perhaps wild beasts. What we found… was far worse."

"At the heart of the sanctuary stood a man who had vanished from our village just weeks prior, bathed in a sickly purple glow. Unbeknownst to us, he had been experimenting with dark magic, twisting the sanctuary’s sacred energy for his own ends."

"When he saw us, he summoned a creature of shadow—something unnatural, black as pitch and hungry for blood. It struck before we could react. Your grandfather didn’t stand a chance. I barely escaped with my life. The guards put down the beast as it chased me through the forest, but the damage was done."

"Years later, your father led a party of guards into the sanctuary, determined to end the evil that had taken his father. None returned. Your mother, already weakened with worry, passed not long after from grief… leaving you in the care of your grandmother."

"You’ve survived what none of them could. You brought that girl back safe, and I swear—when I look at you, I see the fire that once burned in your father’s eyes. But come. Your grandmother needs to see you. She’s already lost too much to that cursed place. She can’t bear to lose you, too."

The player gets control again and is free to do whatever he wants, but can only progress after talking to his grandmother.

The hero’s grandmother says something. I’ll figure that out later.

Torric tells Darian that he must head to the Shrine of Elements in the center of the world and blow the horn to awaken the guardians.

*The hero now gains free control and can explore freely.*
