# [Upon picking up the horn]
When the horn is blown, four beams of light come out of the top of the shrine, striking the centers of each temple. Nothing happens. The camera pans towards the shattered sword hilt, encouraging him to pick it up.

*The player now gains control of the player again. He is free to do whatever, but can only progress the story by picking up the sword hilt.*

When the sword hilt is picked up, the player sees a vision of the door to the Earth Temple is open.

*The player gains control.*
