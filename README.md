# Veil of Aether

## About
*The Veil of Aether* is a free and open-source (FOSS) action-adventure RPG. It is based in the fictional land of Neyvara, a world focused on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water. The protagonist of the game is Darian (the player), a young adult who sets out on an epic adventure to save the world from an evil sorcerer. He must fight through trials and dungeons to reach the final climactic battle.

This repository contains the lore. If you don't know what something referenced is, chances are you'll find it somewhere in the repository. Our plan is to link names of things to their corresponding documents, but that isn't a particularly small task.

## Our mission statement

A free and open-source RPG, powered by passion rather than profit

We strive to be different than corporate games, and here's how:
- 100% free/libre and open source code and assets
- Zero dependence on corporate tools or programs
- Built and maintained by the community
