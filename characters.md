# Characters

## Humans
### Darian
Darian is the protagonist of the story—a young man whose personality reflects the player’s choices. He lives in Gaia Village with his kind grandmother Elda and trains in swordsmanship under Elder Torric’s guidance. Though still finding his place in the world, he shows promise and heart. His closest friend is Elowen, a cheerful girl with a love for singing, and though they’ve never said it aloud, their bond is obvious. Darian’s peaceful life is soon interrupted by a fate that calls him far beyond his quiet village.

### Elowen
She is a bright and kind-hearted girl around Darian’s age, known for her cheerful spirit and ever-present songs that seem to bring life to Gaia Village. Playful yet deeply loyal, she often helps others without hesitation, her sweet singing voice lifting the spirits of everyone around her. Though neither she nor Darian has ever admitted it aloud, their bond is obvious to all — a quiet, growing love marked by warm glances, easy laughter, and an unshakable loyalty to one another.

### Garret
The deceased grandfather of Darian. He was known throughout Gaia Village and beyond for his bold spirit. Never one to turn down a challenge, he chased legends and explored old forgotten ruins when others were too afraid. His sense of adventure made him a local hero to some, and a reckless fool to others. He had a quick smile, a hearty laugh, and an infectious energy that made people believe anything was possible. But once he set his mind on a goal, even good advice often slid right off him. His final journey into the Forest Sanctuary was meant to uncover a secret that could protect the village — but he underestimated the dangers within. Though he never returned, his story lives on in whispers and the proud hearts of those who knew him.

### Elda
Darian’s grandmother. She is the heart of Gaia Village – or at least, that’s how many see her. She’s the kind of person who always has an extra loaf of bread ready, who never lets a traveler leave without a warm meal and a kind word. Time has made her strong in a quiet way. She's not afraid to cry, laugh, or mourn openly, believing emotions are not weaknesses but signs of true strength. Elda holds tightly to Garret’s memory, often telling stories of his adventures by the fireside. She encourages the protagonist to be brave – but also reminds them to be thoughtful, in a way she wishes Garret had been sometimes.

### Bernard
He is a wandering salesman with a knack for finding the oddest trinkets in the unlikeliest places. Always on the move, he’s a bit skittish but endlessly curious, driven by a love of adventure and a tendency to laugh mid-sentence — even when there’s nothing funny. His playful spirit and ever-growing collection of bizarre wares make him a familiar (and unpredictable) face wherever the road leads.

### Mira
A kind-hearted herbalist who runs a small garden. She sometimes needs help gathering rare herbs from nearby woods

### Oswin
A retired knight who spends his days telling wildly exaggerated war stories to anyone who’ll listen, mostly kids who idolize him.

### Fenna
A stern but fair blacksmith who mainly makes farming tools these days. Secretly wishes someone would ask her to forge a weapon again.

### Tamsin
A friendly innkeeper who runs the local inn. Knows everyone's business but in a helpful, grandmotherly way.

### Perrin
A nervous, bumbling would-be inventor. His “helpful” gadgets usually break or cause mild chaos.

### Adric
A serious young man training to be a scholar. Dreams of writing the definitive history of the land  after the war, he hopes to travel the world.

### Bela
An elderly woman who claims she can predict the weather by the aches in her knees. (And she's usually right.)

### Willem
A lazy farmer who always tries to rope the player into doing his chores for him. (“You look strong... maybe you could... uh, help an old farmer out?”)

### Lina and Thom
Two kids always playing some new game, like playing knights and monsters with wooden swords or chasing each other endlessly around the village.

### Brother Caldwell
A gentle priest who maintains the village shrine but spends most of his time chasing birds out of it.

### Jorren
A wandering bard who sometimes stops in Gaia Village, playing a lute and singing ballads about “heroes of old.”

### Veyric
The power-hungry sorcerer once thought to be the true villain is a man driven by pride and a burning desire to master all four elements. Unlike Dolmordai’s cold calculation, Veyric is more impulsive—quick to act, quicker to anger, and dangerously reckless with the dark forces he commands. He dabbles in forbidden magic with little regard for consequence, believing power is worth any price. Though once human, his obsession has warped both his body and mind, leaving behind a brilliant but broken man who sees domination not as evil, but as destiny.

### Torric
Elder of the men. He is calm, deliberate, and slow to speak, often taking long moments to consider his words. His wisdom comes from years of experience, but his stoic nature sometimes makes him seem distant or difficult to read. He is deeply dedicated to his people and the survival of his village, carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. He sometimes struggles with being a leader in times of uncertainty. Though often reserved, Torric cares deeply for those he leads. His kindness is shown through actions more than words, often working in the background to ensure the wellbeing of Gaia Village and its people.

### Terra
“Earth Wizard” Guardian of the Earth Temple. He is a rock in every sense – stubborn, patient, and seemingly immovable. Once he makes a decision, it is very difficult to change his mind. He doesn't say much, but when he does speak, it's with great weight and meaning. Every word feels carved into stone. Terra views the world like a garden — something that must be tended and protected over time. He is slow to anger, but if pushed too far, he becomes a force of nature that few can stop.


## Dwarves
Korric: A young dwarf who lacks confidence in himself, secretly likes Selira the elf but is afraid to act

### Borin
A veteran warrior who trains new recruits. Gruff but respected.

### Thava
A skilled engineer/artificer known for crazy contraptions

### Drogan
Young, ambitious dwarf who dreams of one day leading his own forge hall

### Magni
Elder runesmith, wise but slightly eccentric (he “talks” to the stones)

### Hildra
Tavern keeper in the dwarven city, with sharp wit and a sharper rolling pin

### Varek
A dwarf who left his mountain to study magic under the elves (seen as a bit of an outcast).

### Zimri
Elder of the dwarves. He doesn’t mince words. He’s blunt, honest, and has a very straightforward approach to most situations. His gruff exterior hides a deep loyalty to his people, and he has no time for pretense or unnecessary formalities. Zimri takes great pride in his people’s craftsmanship and strength. He often talks about the “old ways” of dwarven society, and he expects others to respect that. Though he can seem intimidating, Zimri has a soft spot for the young and those in need.He’s more than willing to lend a hand to those who prove themselves, though he’ll often disguise his kindness with sarcasm or tough-love remarks.

### Ignis
“Fire Mage” Guardian of the Fire Temple. He burns with passion for justice and good. His loyalty to his people, his land, and those he deems righteous is unshakable – even if it leads him into reckless actions at times. He has a temper that flares easily when he witnesses cruelty or injustice, but he always channels it toward protecting others rather than destruction for its own sake. Beneath the fire and shouting, Ignis is deeply compassionate. His rage is born from a desire to see peace, not from hatred.


## Merfolk
Coren: Merfolk warrior who once swam far beyond the boundaries to scout enemy forces

### Vasea
An oracle who interprets the songs of the deep currents

### Neris
A mischievious young mermaid who is always getting into trouble

### Caspir
Stoic guardian of the sacred tidepools

### Thalina
Tender of the Coral Gardens, the source of many healing herbs and relics

### Tibor
Elder of the merfolk. He is serene and thoughtful, often speaking in calm, measured tones. His personality mirrors the flowing nature of the water, always moving forward but in a way that encourages reflection. As a Merfolk, Tibor has seen the vastness of the oceans and is always eager to learn from others. He believes in the importance of understanding all perspectives, which often leads him to seek valance between conflicting ideas. Despite his openness to new ideas, Tibor holds strong to the traditions of his people. He believes in the importance of preserving history and teaching younger generations of the value of their culture and the sea.

### Aqua
“Water Sorceress” Guardian of the Water Temple. Her appearance is cool and emotionless at first glance, and many mistake her for being cold-hearted. In truth, she feels emotions very deeply – she just controls them behind a serene mask. Once trust is earned, she shows immense kindness, offering quiet comfort and support without expecting anything in return. She relates especially well to those who feel lost or burdened. Aqua is fiercely protective of those who suffer, seeing it as her duty to soothe and heal, like a river giving life to dry lands.


## Elves
Selira: A young elf maiden who likes to sit by waterfalls and daydream, secretly likes Korric the dwarf

### Lorien
An elven scholar who collects ancient tales and lost magics

### Sariah
A skilled archer and scout, one of the first to spot signs of corruption in the woods

### Faelan
Young, curious elf who is fascinated by humans and their “short lives but great passions”

### Vaelin
The aloof, battle-hardened captain of the elven guard

### Isolde
healer and song-weaver, said to soothe the forest itself

### Evron
Elder of the elves. He exudes a natural sense of elegance and dignity. His movements and speech are measured and refined, and he carries the weight of centuries of elven history on his shoulders. Evron is perceptive and thoughtful, often seeing the bigger picture. However, his long life has made him somewhat detached from the concerns of everyday people, preferring to think on a more philosophical or long-term scale. Though he values peace and understanding with other races, Evron is deeply protective of his own. He believes that the elves must maintain their unique culture and strength in a world where they are increasingly rare. With age comes a certain rigidity, and Evron can be stubborn when it comes to changes he feels threaten the well-being of his people. He can sometimes seem out of touch with newer ideas but is always open to conversation if presented with a strong argument.

### Zephyr
“Wind Enchantress” Guardian of the Wind Temple. She has a quiet, ethereal presence. She rarely speaks unless she has something meaningful to say, and when she does, her words often sound like riddles or ancient proverbs. Despite her serious wisdom, she enjoys testing the player with puzzles, light jokes, and little challenges. She believes true growth comes through curiosity and exploration, not being spoon-fed answers. She subtly guides the hero rather than giving direct orders, nudging them toward realizing their own potential.


## Dragons
### Elymion
“Radiant Wisdom” Elymion, elder of the light dragons is a being of immense wisdom and quiet power. Serene and deliberate in all he does, he rarely acts directly, instead guiding through riddles, visions, and insight. His ancient eyes reflect ages past, filled with both knowledge and sorrow—especially over the loss of Seraviel, once like a son to him. Though distant, Elymion remains a vigilant guardian of balance in the Light Realm, watching and waiting for a champion worthy of the trials he has prepared.

### Seraviel
“Healing Light” Seraviel was a devoted servant of Elymion and a guardian of balance. Impulsive yet well-meaning, he possessed a deep wisdom tempered by a strong belief in his own strength—a trait that became both his greatest gift and deepest flaw. Seraviel often acted from the heart, eager to protect others and prove himself worthy of his role, but his overconfidence left him vulnerable to the corrupting whispers of Erste Sünde. His fall into darkness as Seravokh was not born of malice, but of pride and misplaced trust in his own will.

### Seravokh
“Corrupted Light” The name for Seraviel after he fell from the light

### Vaerun
“Enduring Stone” Provides the Earth Trial, is stoic, patient, and deliberate. He speaks slowly but every word carries weight. Kind of like an old tree that’s seen a thousand seasons. He often pauses mid-sentence as if considering not just what to say, but whether it needs to be said at all.

### Nerith
“Eternal Flow” Provides the Water Trial, is calm, wise, but emotionally deep underneath. He has a soft voice, almost like a river trickling – but if angered, it’s a tidal wave. He answers questions with questions sometimes, gently steering the conversation like currents steering a boat.

### Solvyr
“Soul of Flame” Provides the Fire Trial, is proud, passionate, and a little impulsive. He talks fast, acts fast, loves challenges, and respects boldness. He occasionally laughs – a crackling, ember-like sound – especially when someone shows unexpected courage.

### Caerith
“Free Wind” Provides the Wind Trial, is mysterious, playful, and philosophical. His words are poetic and a little cryptic, like riddles riding the breeze. He likes to suddenly disappear during conversations and reappear elsewhere, mid-sentence without warning.


## Demons
### Dolmordai
The Demon King is a being of immense pride and ambition, driven by an insatiable desire to conquer all realms and bend the elements to his will. Unlike many who hunger for power, Dolmordai is never reckless—every move he makes is calculated, every battle a carefully woven strategy. He speaks with cold confidence, his presence commanding dread without ever raising his voice. As a war general, he is unmatched, not because of raw power alone, but because he understands the art of control—of others, of fear, and of fate itself. His return is not chaos unleashed, but a storm that knows exactly where to strike.

### Inferna
Fire Demon, scourge of the Fire Temple

### Leviathan
Water Serpent, scourge of the Water Temple

### Typhon
Wind Beast, scourge of the Wind Temple

### Geode
Earth Golem, scourge of the Earth Temple


## Hybrid
