# Cyclone Guard

This elven group goes through extreme military training. The training includes extreme patience training, advanced acedemics, brutal stillness training, and more. As a result, they are the best of the best elf warriors. These elves are able to go an entire day without moving a muscle, but still be able to react nearly instantly to something. They have also mastered an ancient elven telepathic communication ability that any elf can use but few learn because of the difficulty, making them highly coordinated. Only three to four out of over a hundred that train make it past the final challenge and obtain the bow of the hurricane, becoming an official Cyclone Guard. Those that fail the final challenge get a high rank in ordinary elite elf groups. These elves learn great stealth, archery, melee combat, and several martial arts. Members of this grop wear special insignia and ate charged with guarding the elder, sacred artifacts and monuments, and officials. Even the lowest ranking Cyclone Guard member outranks the highest regular military general, giving this group extreme power over other areas of the military.
