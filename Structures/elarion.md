# Spire of Elarion

The Spire of Elarion is an elven research tower high above a cliff face. The main purpose of this is to research the wind and wind magic. The elves here live in almost complete solitude, with a small guard regiment near the base. The Spire was destroyed in the War of Fallen Glory.
