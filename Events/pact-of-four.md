# Pact of the Four

The four elders met in Earth Province to discuss an alliance. In the end, an alliance was formed. After the meeting was concluded and the pact was signed, Korrin raised his voice: "Halvarn is still holding out. If we make a move, we make it against the enemy besieging him!" This was met with a shout and led to the Battle of the Breaking Dawn.
