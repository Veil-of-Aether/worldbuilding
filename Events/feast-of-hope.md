# Feast of Hope

Right after the Battle of the Breaking Dawn, all the men had a much-needed feast. During this feast, Halvarn gave his bow as a gift to Korrin. This was also the feast during which an invasion of the Central Plain, later known as the Battle of the Plain, was planned by Halvarn and other leaders.
