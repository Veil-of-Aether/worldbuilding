# Sword of the Elements
The Sword of the Elements is a mythical blade said to be created by the ancient gods. This sword bears the emblems of Wind, Water, Earth, and Fire on the four sections of the blade, and a mysterious fifth symbol on the center of the hilt. The sword rests in the Pedestal of Ages in the center of the Shrine of Elements, directly beneath the Spire of Equinox. If one with right intentions draws the blade, he gains power over all four elements; however if someone with evil intentions tries to draw it, the blade will shatter into four pieces and each will travel to its respective temple, leaving the one who drew it with only a hilt.
