# Bow of the Hurricane

A Bow of the Hurricane is a special weapon wielded by only the Cyclone Guard. Every member has one and is mandated to have it on him at all times. Each bow is given a unique name when the Cyclone Guard trainee passes the final challenge and earns his bow. These bows can be used as a well-ranging bow, a single longsword, or split into two shortswords, making it a very unique and powerful weapon. Nobody except the Cyclone Guard knows how to transform it into another form, but all of them can do it in a split second.
