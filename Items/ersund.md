# Ersund
Ersund is the source of all evil. It is a large, dark purple stone created by Dolmordai long before his rise to power. Not long before the War of Fallen Glory, Seraviel was seduced by its power and attempted to imprison Dolmordai inside to claim the stone for himself, but he accidentally bound the demon king to the stone, causing him to be immortal is long as the stone still existed.
