# Korric and Selira quest

### Reward:
Wind silk gloves from Selira and a dwarven stell dagger from Korric

### Effects: 
Korric and Selira are now rarely seen apart. During the postgame, the player gets a chance to be best man at their wedding.

### Plot
Korric and Selira secretly like each other, but because of the resentment and pride between dwarves and elves, neither has talked to the other yet. The quest initiates when the player finds Korric secretly admiring Selira as she sits by the waterfall and sings during the early hours of the night. Korric will ask the player to deliver a love letter to Selira since both the elves and dwarves have good relations with the humans. When the player agrees and brings the letter to Selira, she gives him an enchanted gem to give in return. When Korric recieves the stone, Selira speaks through it and asks him to meet on the border. Korric is nervous at first because he thinks his written letter is too simple compared to what Selira gave him, but through choosing the right dialogue choices, the player can eventually convince him to go. Korric brings some of his grandma's famous Fiery Fungus stew with him to show Selira. When they meet, they both thank the player and give him a gift for helping get them together.
