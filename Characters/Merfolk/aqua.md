# Aqua
## “Water Sorceress”
### Water Guardian

Guardian of the Water Temple. Her appearance is cool and emotionless at first glance, and many mistake her for being cold-hearted. In truth, she feels emotions very deeply – she just controls them behind a serene mask. Once trust is earned, she shows immense kindness, offering quiet comfort and support without expecting anything in return. She relates especially well to those who feel lost or burdened. Aqua is fiercely protective of those who suffer, seeing it as her duty to soothe and heal, like a river giving life to dry lands.
