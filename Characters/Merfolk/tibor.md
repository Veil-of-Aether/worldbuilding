### Elder of the merfolk

Tibor is the elder of the merfolk. He is sereve and thoughtful, and generaly calm. He is always reflecting on his past and learning from his mistakes as he moves forward in life. He always wants to learn from others and understand all perspectives. His most prized posession is his sword, which General Halvarn engraved his signature on when Tibor was but a young boy.
