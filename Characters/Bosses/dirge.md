# The Dirge

The Dirge is the same cursed musician that played to destroy the elves in Elarion Spire. It has been sitting in the wreckage of the tower playing mornful tunes ever since Dolmordai's defeat. When agitated by the player, the Dirge starts using its music to animate stones and other objects to attack with.
