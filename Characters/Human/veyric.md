# Veyric
## "Disciple of the Void"
### Evil sorceror

The power-hungry sorcerer once thought to be the true villain is a man driven by pride and a burning desire to master all four elements. Unlike Dolmordai’s cold calculation, Veyric is more impulsive—quick to act, quicker to anger, and dangerously reckless with the dark forces he commands. He dabbles in forbidden magic with little regard for consequence, believing power is worth any price. Though once human, his obsession has warped both his body and mind, leaving behind a brilliant but broken man who sees domination not as evil, but as destiny.
