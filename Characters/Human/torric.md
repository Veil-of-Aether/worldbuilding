# Torric
Elder of the men. He is calm, deliberate, and slow to speak, often taking long moments to consider his words. His wisdom comes from years of experience, but his stoic nature sometimes makes him seem distant or difficult to read. He is deeply dedicated to his people and the survival of his village, carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. He sometimes struggles with being a leader in times of uncertainty. Though often reserved, Torric cares deeply for those he leads. His kindness is shown through actions more than words, often working in the background to ensure the wellbeing of Gaia Village and its people.
