# Darian
Darian is the protagonist of the story—a young man whose personality reflects the player’s choices. He lives in Gaia Village with his kind grandmother Elda and trains in swordsmanship under Elder Torric’s guidance. Though still finding his place in the world, he shows promise and heart. His closest friend is Elowen, a cheerful girl with a love for singing, and though they’ve never said it aloud, their bond is obvious. Darian’s peaceful life is soon interrupted by a fate that calls him far beyond his quiet village.
