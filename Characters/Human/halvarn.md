# General Halvarn
Halvarn was the greatest general during the War of Fallen Glory. He fought alongside his men and never backed down from a battle. While under siege, he gave many of his rations to his soldiers. Halvarn was the one who pierced through the enemy defenses into the Shrine of Elements and blew the Horn of Awakening.
