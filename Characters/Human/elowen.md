# Elowen
She is a bright and kind-hearted girl around Darian’s age, known for her cheerful spirit and ever-present songs that seem to bring life to Gaia Village. Playful yet deeply loyal, she often helps others without hesitation, her sweet singing voice lifting the spirits of everyone around her. Though neither she nor Darian has ever admitted it aloud, their bond is obvious to all — a quiet, growing love marked by warm glances, easy laughter, and an unshakable loyalty to one another.
