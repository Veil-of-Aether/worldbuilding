# Korrin

Korrin was a boy who slipped past Dolmordai's forces during the Siege of the Forest Sanctuary. He led the small band of humans into the Battle of the Breaking Dawn, and General Halvarn gave him a bow, now known as Korrin's Gift, after the battle. Korrin later halped Halvarn break into the Shrine of Elements to awaken the guardians during the Battle of the Plain.
