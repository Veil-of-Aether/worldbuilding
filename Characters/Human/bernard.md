### Wandering salesman

He is a wandering salesman with a knack for finding the oddest trinkets in the unlikeliest places. Always on the move, he’s a bit skittish but endlessly curious, driven by a love of adventure and a tendency to laugh mid-sentence — even when there’s nothing funny. His playful spirit and ever-growing collection of bizarre wares make him a familiar (and unpredictable) face wherever the road leads.
