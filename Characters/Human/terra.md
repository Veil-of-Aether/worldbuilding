# Terra
“Earth Wizard” Guardian of the Earth Temple. He is a rock in every sense – stubborn, patient, and seemingly immovable. Once he makes a decision, it is very difficult to change his mind. He doesn't say much, but when he does speak, it's with great weight and meaning. Every word feels carved into stone. Terra views the world like a garden — something that must be tended and protected over time. He is slow to anger, but if pushed too far, he becomes a force of nature that few can stop.
