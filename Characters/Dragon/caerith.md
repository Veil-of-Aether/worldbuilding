## "Free Wind"
### Light Dragon representing the Wind element
Provides the Wind Trial, is mysterious, playful, and philosophical. His words are poetic and a little cryptic, like riddles riding the breeze. He likes to suddenly disappear during conversations and reappear elsewhere, mid-sentence without warning.
