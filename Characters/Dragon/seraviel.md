# Seraviel
## “Healing Light”
### Elymion's advisor
Seraviel was a devoted servant of Elymion and a guardian of balance. Impulsive yet well-meaning, he possessed a deep wisdom tempered by a strong belief in his own strength—a trait that became both his greatest gift and deepest flaw. Seraviel often acted from the heart, eager to protect others and prove himself worthy of his role, but his overconfidence left him vulnerable to the corrupting whispers of Erste Sünde. His fall into darkness as Seravokh was not born of malice, but of pride and misplaced trust in his own will.

# Seravokh
## “Corrupted Light”
### Seraviel after falling from the light
The name for Seraviel after he fell from the light into darkness. Seraviel was taken by pride and thought he could use the power of Erste Sünde to help in the fight against Dolmordai, but was corrupted by it and became evil.
