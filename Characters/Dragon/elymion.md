# Elymion
## "Radiant Wisdom"
### Elder of the Light Dragons
Elymion, elder of the light dragons is a being of immense wisdom and quiet power. Serene and deliberate in all he does, he rarely acts directly, instead guiding through riddles, visions, and insight. His ancient eyes reflect ages past, filled with both knowledge and sorrowâ€”especially over the loss of Seraviel, once like a son to him. Though distant, Elymion remains a vigilant guardian of balance in the Light Realm, watching and waiting for a champion worthy of the trials he has prepared.
