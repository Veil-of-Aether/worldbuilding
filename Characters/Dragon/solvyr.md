## “Soul of Flame”
### Light Dragon representing the Fire element
Provides the Fire Trial, is proud, passionate, and a little impulsive. He talks fast, acts fast, loves challenges, and respects boldness. He occasionally laughs – a crackling, ember-like sound – especially when someone shows unexpected courage.
