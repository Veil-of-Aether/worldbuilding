## “Eternal Flow”
### Light Dragon representing the Water element
Provides the Water Trial, is calm, wise, but emotionally deep underneath. He has a soft voice, almost like a river trickling – but if angered, it’s a tidal wave. He answers questions with questions sometimes, gently steering the conversation like currents steering a boat.
