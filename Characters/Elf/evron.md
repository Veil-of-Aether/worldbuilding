# Evron
### Elder of the elves

Evron is a very wise but still somewhat proud elf. Centuries of elven history have had an impact on this elf, as he sometimes seems rather detached from the world. Evron has witnessed many things, including the War of Fallen Glory, the rise of Veyric, and more. He is often uninterested in conversation unless you have something extremely interesting to talk about.
