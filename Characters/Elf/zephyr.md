### Zephyr
“Wind Enchantress” Guardian of the Wind Temple. She has a quiet, ethereal presence. She rarely speaks unless she has something meaningful to say, and when she does, her words often sound like riddles or ancient proverbs. Despite her serious wisdom, she enjoys testing the player with puzzles, light jokes, and little challenges. She believes true growth comes through curiosity and exploration, not being spoon-fed answers. She subtly guides the hero rather than giving direct orders, nudging them toward realizing their own potential.
