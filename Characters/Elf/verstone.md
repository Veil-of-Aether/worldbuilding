# Verstone

Verstone is an elf veteran from the War of Fallen Glory. He hates Dolmordai and his followers with a passion because his twin brother was killed during the Fall of Elarion Spire, and his father and closest friend were killed in the Battle of the Plain. He has vowed that he won't stop fighting until Dolmordai is defeated. He joined the *Shrouded Flame* when he heard of it.
