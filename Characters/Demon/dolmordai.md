# Dolmordai
The Demon King is a being of immense pride and ambition, driven by an insatiable desire to conquer all realms and bend the elements to his will. Unlike many who hunger for power, Dolmordai is never reckless—every move he makes is calculated, every battle a carefully woven strategy. He speaks with cold confidence, his presence commanding dread without ever raising his voice. As a war general, he is unmatched, not because of raw power alone, but because he understands the art of control—of others, of fear, and of fate itself. His return is not chaos unleashed, but a storm that knows exactly where to strike.
