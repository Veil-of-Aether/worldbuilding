# Ignis
## “Fire Mage”
### Fire Guardian

Guardian of the Fire Temple. He burns with passion for justice and good. His loyalty to his people, his land, and those he deems righteous is unshakable – even if it leads him into reckless actions at times. He has a temper that flares easily when he witnesses cruelty or injustice, but he always channels it toward protecting others rather than destruction for its own sake. Beneath the fire and shouting, Ignis is deeply compassionate. His rage is born from a desire to see peace, not from hatred.
