# Age of Stirring
### 6th age

When the Age of Stirring began, the world was mostly healed from the war. A man named Veyric began to worship Dolmordai and gain immense power. Tensions started to rise once again among the four races. The peace, unity, and healing of Neyvara that had been so painstakingly established was at risk of shattering in a matter of days. This is the present age, during which Darian must destroy Veyric and help to restore peace and unity once more.
