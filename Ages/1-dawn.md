# Age of Dawn
### 1st age

The Age of Dawn began when Neyvara was founded. During this time period, the four races on the surface lived in perfect harmony. The Light Dragons soared above majestically, ever watching. The ancient celestial beings in the Light Realm lived together with the Light Dragons, watching the Sacred Light.
