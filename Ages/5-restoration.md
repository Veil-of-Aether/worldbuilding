# Age of Restoration
### 5th age

During the Age of Restoration, the world began to recover from the War of Fallen Glory. The completely decimated world began to heal, and fighting ceased. This age was filled with sorrow but at the same time joy, as those lost were mourned while the world was rebuilt by the now unified races.
