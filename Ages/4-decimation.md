# Age of Decimation
### 4th age

The Age of Decimation began when Seraviel fell from glory and bound Dolmordai's soul to Ersund. Dolmordai used this as an opportunity to start mustering forces together, ready for war against the already fractured world. This era includes the War of Fallen Glory, and the positive outcome was the total unity of the four races once again.
