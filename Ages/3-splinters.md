# Age of Splinters
### 3rd age

The Age of Splinters was a dark time in Neyvara's history during which the four races went beyond small skirmishes and fought wars with each other. The world lay in ruin and there wasn't a spot you could go without someone from one race bickering with someone from another. The world threatened to rip itself apart as the corruption of Ersund ingrained itself more and more into everyone.
