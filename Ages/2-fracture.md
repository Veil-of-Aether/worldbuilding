# Age of Fracture
### 2nd age

The Age of Fracture began when Dolmordai of the celestial beings sought to rule and created Ersund. This evil stone corrupted minds. The celestial beings were corrupted the most thoroughly, becoming demons. Elves, dwarves, merfolk, and men began to grow greedy and selfish. Only the Light Dragons were able to resist corruption. During this age, tensions began to rise between the four races and small skirmishes started to break out.
