# Battle at Embercradle Manor

The dwarf lords were meeting together in Embercradle Manor to discuss fighting Dolmordai when the shadow beaats emerged from under the manor. The guards were gone before they could utter a sound. The council continued on, with the lords unaware of what was happening. When they realized that shadow beasts had infiltrated, it was already too late. Elder Zimri I of the dwarves and his men attempted to fight long enough for as many as possible to escape, but in the end, only a few scribes made it out. By dawn, Embercradle Manor was reduced to ruins. This battle was what finally prompted the new elder, Zimri II, to send a message to the humans for an alliance.
