# Battle of the Breaking Dawn

This battle marks the turning point in the War of Fallen Glory. Twenty-seven days into the Siege of the Forest Sanctuary, the alliance had been finalized by the four races. The elves, dwarves, and merfolk send their armies to Earth Province to aid the men in rescuing General Halvarn and his men. As dawn broke on the twenty-eighth day of siege, Halvarn awoke to a sudden noise from the trees. He recognized it instantly as dwarven axes being drawn. He quickly awoke his men and told them to prepare for battle. Elven horseback archers emerged from the trees, then armies of elves, dwarves, merfolk, and a small band of the remaining men led by Korrin. Dolmordai's army was taken by surprise and rushed to meet the enemy. Halvarn then rallied his men and attacked from the inside of the enemy circle. The battle was over in minutes, as Dolmordai's army was taken by surprise and had to fight from literally all sides.
