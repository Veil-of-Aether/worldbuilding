# Siege of the Forest Sanctuary

Following the Stand at Weathercrest, Halvarn's men were forced to retreat to the Forest Sanctuary. Dolmordai's army surrounded the Sanctuary. On the second day of the siege, a young boy no older than 17 named Korrin slipped out to tell the remnent of remains humans of the siege. During the twenty-seven day siege, the men were only kept together by their general. Halvarn would give up his rations so his men could have more. He would talk to them one-on-one - not as a general, but as a brother. When a man tried to run away, Halvarn grabbed him before spending the rest of the night by his side.
